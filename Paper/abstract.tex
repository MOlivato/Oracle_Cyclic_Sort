% Abstract

\noindent The {\sc CyclicSort} algorithm takes $\Theta(n^2)$ comparisons in order 
to sort an array $v$ of $n$ integers.

Even in the best case, when given an already sorted array $v$, {\sc 
CyclicSort} still employs at least $n(n-1)$ comparisons.

Yet, until now, {\sc CyclicSort} was the only sorting algorithm that, 
assuming $O(1)$ working memory,

could guarantee the minimum possible number of writes on the array $v$.

And, since this property may turn out to be the most significant factor 
in certain niche applications, {\sc Cyclic Sort} retains its own (though 
modest) place in the Olympus of sorting algorithms.

We propose smarter and more performant algorithms with this property, 
and a first rough analysis of the issue of minimizing the number of 
write operations within the array $v$ to be sorted.

One basic tool in our approach is an oracle subroutine which returns a 
position $i$ such that element $v[i]$ is not at its correct place, or a 
check that array $v$ is already sorted. This subroutine offers a nice 
decomposition opportunity for this problem.
